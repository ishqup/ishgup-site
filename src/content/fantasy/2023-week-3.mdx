## Rankings: Ishan's Version

1. Ishan (2-1) ↑2
2. Neil (2-1) —
3. Savan (2-1) ↓2
4. Sam (2-1) —
5. Ian (0-3) ↑1
6. Mike (2-1) ↑2
7. Joey (2-1) —
8. Prad (0-3) ↓3

## Summary

After back-to-back dominant performances, Savan finally falls to Mike's injury riddled team. The loss may just be a rough spot as all
of his players underperformed their usual output. Aaron Jones was also out with an injury and Kelley was subbed in place of him. Mike
is proving me right so far, starting off with a 2-1 record without Kupp and JT and ending this week as the second highest scorer. His 
team can only get better after his players come back and he has seemed to overcome the management issues that we have seen in past years. 
Hopefully he can keep it up, week 5 we can expect a fully healthy team.

After starting 2-0, Sam has fallen to Joey which marks the quickest we've had no undefeated teams in the Stonks Era. Both sides don't
seem to have many issues on either end. Sam could just improve on tight end and Joey at running back. Ja'Marr has finally bounced back
after a slow start to the season and hopefully will continue to produce as Joey's receivers are his biggest strength.

Brutal final drive in the Bengals-Rams game as Neil only needed 1 more point from Puka to pull out the win. This loss drops Ian to 0-3
despite being the 2nd highest scorer in the league. Hopefully the tides turn in his favor but this is just sad at this point. Nothing
more can be said about this game.

Ishan falls short of the scoring record with 211.60 points absolutely blowing out Prad with almost all his players scoring a TD. This
performance is most definitely not repeatable but there's some consistent play within the team that should allow the success to continue.
Prad will have to bounce back from 0-3, which is his worst start ever after his unconventional dominance of the league. Maybe these waiver
pickups will help him bounce back, one thing we've learned is that once it's playoffs your regular season doesn't mean anything.

## Week 4 Matchup Predictions

Ishan beats Mike

Savan beats Joey

Neil beats Prad

Ian beats Sam
