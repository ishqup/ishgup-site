## Summary

Losing to that yee yee fat mofo who rides Kelce more than T-Swift put me in my feels. Here's a poem I wrote in my depression... Sorry for the
late post. I call it "Guess Who"

~

His team is in shambles.

Tanked to have 3 Tight Ends.

The waiver system is shit.

He needs FAAB he can spend.

His lineups are gambles.

Who is he?

~

He argued and fought.

He took my waiver spot.

I love my Tight Ends.

And I saved him a slot.

The FAAB I would spend.

Is surely a lot.

I didn’t get my Tight End.

My wrath I have brought.

Upon his pitiful team.

And I’ve left him distraught.

Who am I?

~

I’ve won back to back.

But I’ve lost three times.

My QB is Dak.

I just needed something that rhymes.

I’ve done this in the past.

Start the season off last.

But when playoffs come around.

My team hits the gas.

Who am I?

~

He beat me 11.

I beat him once.

He has Mike Evans.

He hits lots of blunts.

He sends the same screenshots.

He’s been doing it for months.

He has an announcement.

“I’m going to Thaint Woo-ouis cunts”

Who is he?

~

His team is a scam.

His team is real shit.

Spends time with his fam.

Mainly his brotherbit.

He’s a Caleb Williams truther.

Jk, that’s a lie.

Prayed for CMC to die.

To be a Jordan Mason user.

Who is he?

~

I went to school with him.

He prayed my RB’s achilles was brittle.

I still manage to win.

With half my team in the hospital.

I get lots of points from all of my Nabers.

My head is in Paris not checking the waivers.

I know that I’ll get the points that I need.

Just not from the help of Rashid Shaheed.

Who am I?

~

I’ve been called mid.

My team gets real injured.

With Kupp off the grid.

My team is not hindered.

My QB is Lamar.

Maybe this time I’ll get far.

I look like Nick Foles.

But retired I have not.

My team has no holes.

I’m no longer a bot.

Who am I?

~

His QB throws to my Tight End and Cook.

This week he left my old roommate shook.

He owns Kittle but starts Bowers.

His WR is so fast they call him Cheetah.

He’s a QB’s best friend because he’s a speeder.

So fast, police abuse their powers.

Too bad he has nobody that can throw.

Because Tua is now Damar Hamlin’s hoe.

Can’t wait to see how far he’ll go.

He’s started the season 3-0.

Who is he?

## HAIKU-BIT

White is always right

Brown is in the ground right now

Just wait till we cook.

~

Ishan is cheating

Prad took care of business

Unlike the Cowboys.

~

Sam picks up Chuba

Pradhyum fancies Chubbas

Canada’s Cowboy.

~

Chicago got fleeced

Williams is not a beast

He will never feast.

~

Savan is a bum

Bijan Mustard is very dumb

Change your name, pond scum.

~

Ian’s gonna lose

His bench will drop 2oh2

His starters are poo.
