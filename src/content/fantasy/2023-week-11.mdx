## Summary

WHAT’S UP GUYS???

Week 11 was a movie, on and off the field. Mike’s team is shambles. Welcome to the toilet bowl! He’s not officially eliminated, 
but losing Burrow and potentially Kupp will bring his fantasy football hopes to an end. Meanwhile, Ishan’s team continues to be mid. 
I’m not going to waste time analyzing his team.

Prad’s team is still struggling and is a favorite to join Mike in the toilet bowl. I can’t even call his RBs walking Ls anymore as 
Achane hurt his knee again and ETN had a mid game. Starting 3 TEs is wild, but I wouldn’t expect anything else. Neil somehow wins this 
week after Andrews and Walker leave the game early. Maybe Prad gives Neil a TE and they both feast in the process. Doubt it tho.

Joey and Savan had a close matchup. Joey’s bench played their hearts out, too bad we aren’t playing best ball. This team will definitely 
bounce back since they rank high in Ishan’s most scary team scale. Savan was rooting for AJB the whole game and in turn Smith came in 
clutch and continues to be a Cowboys D/ST merchant. One of the worst teams in the league and it will show next week.

Ian and Sam have the most electric matchup of the week. Calvin Ridley showed flashes of why he was drafted early af, but will probably 
be a bust again next week. Barkley and Allen had themselves a day, covering for Ekeler and LaPorta’s mid statline. AJB’s streak of 
carrying Sam has come to an end as he’s on a 3-game skid. 

I hope you enjoyed the best analysis that Stonks Fantasy Football has to offer.
