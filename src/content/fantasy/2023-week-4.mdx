## Rankings: Ishan's Version

1. Neil (3-1) ↑1
2. Ishan (3-1) ↓1
3. Savan (3-1) —
4. Sam (3-1) —
5. Ian (0-4) —
6. Mike (2-2) —
7. Joey (2-2) —
8. Prad (0-4) —

## Summary

Really just a week of blowouts all around, the top 4 teams have all proved that their team can produce so far, the bottom 2 have struggled heavily,
and Mike and Joey are in a weird spot where they could do better and either injury, underperformance, or tough matchup has kept them at 2-2. Ishan
dropped considerably from his 200+ performance last week, which can be attributed to a few injuries to Davante and Higgins and an underwhelming 
Dolphins performance this week. Luckily, his matchup was against Mike. Mike will finally get Kupp and JT back in Week 5, which after a nice 2-2 start 
could be the thing he needs to push his team over the hump and be a contender.

Ian once again takes another loss, however this time it is by a considerable margin as Sam drops a light 200 bomb. Seems like Ian can't get much worse 
luck than this and I hope the tides turn his way next week. He has an easier matchup against Prad, the other 0-4 team in a battle of the bums.

Savan's riding on the Cowboys D/ST success as they put up another dominant performance and prove that this output might just be sustainable (I hope 
not and that statement curses it). Joey didn't do bad but unfortunate matchup and could've done better had the Steelers not put up -6.

Prad's team is **** and with all the waiver pick ups you wonder when he'll pull in his first win. Neil is just good.

## Week 5 Matchup Predictions

Ishan beats Joey

Savan beats Sam

Neil beats Mike

Ian beats Prad

## Notes

* Players that were out this week: Cooper Kupp, Jonathan Taylor, Austin Ekeler, Saquon Barkley, Javonte Williams, Diontae Johnson
* Tee Higgins broken rib, Matthew Judon torn bicep
* Worst start by Prad of all time at 0-4
* Sam records a 200+ game the week after Ishan
