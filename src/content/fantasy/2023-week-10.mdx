## Summary

Back to some longer posts before Sam takes over next week! Let's start off with Sam's game, well actually, Joey's game. Joey reminding Sam that
every day he challenges him, no matter what the activity may be, it is always Father's day. Joey has had a knack for beating teams while they're on
top and humbling them. Sam on the other hand, has seemed to be choking under the spotlight and while he is still tied for first, there's 4 other teams
on his tail.

The team that seems to be on Sam's tail the most is Neil's team. Absolutely dominating his matchup against the 3rd highest scorer Ian, it doesn't seem
like Neil needs Jefferson at all. Ian can't catch a break on the other hand, and this marks the end of his 4 game win streak after starting off a brutal
0-5 to start the season. Both of these teams are doing solid, and Ian shouldn't be discouraged from this loss, but he better think twice about benching
Gibbs.

Two teams that aren't doing too hot are Prad and Ishan, with their squads practically all on their bye week or injured, there wasn't many options on who to
start this week. Ishan pulled together a solid squad despite his entire bench being on bye and Higgins injured, while Prad put up a decent fight with only
Pickens and McBride as eligible replacements. Ishan should be back to form next week, but Prad will need to figure out what to do with his team that is a
likely candidate for the Toilet Bowl.

The other candidate for the Toilet Bowl is Mike with a considerable margin of PF to make up for in the last 4 games of the season. In a terrible MNF matchup,
Mike was pretty close to beating Savan but fell short and is tied for last place. Savan was not having a great performance either with Michael Thomas, Aaron Jones,
and Taysom Hill putting up dud numbers. He will have Hurts and Smith back next week, so there is likely little to worry about on his end.

Exciting week next week as Ishan, Joey, and Prad go to visit Ian, Mike, and Sam in Maryland! Sam will be taking over the Power Rankings for the weekend and it
will likely be better than anything I put out. I will probably only have my algorithm be the same for the week but everything else will be all his doing. Hope
y'all are ready for the takeover!

## Week 11 Matchup Predictions

[My Pick] Sam -106 / 52.43% - 48.57% / +110 Ian

Mike +271 / 27.53% - 73.47% / -257 Ishan [My Pick]

Prad +168 / 38.05% - 62.95% / -161 Neil [My Pick]

Savan +111 / 48.36% - 52.64% / -107 Joey [My Pick]

## Notes

* Ian's 4 game win streak comes to an end
* Dolphins, Chiefs, Eagles, and Rams on bye making this likely one of the lowest scoring weeks the entire season
* Get ready for Sam takeover next week!
