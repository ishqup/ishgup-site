## Rankings: Ishan's Version

1. Savan (1-0)
2. Ishan (1-0)
3. Sam (1-0)
4. Neil (0-1)
5. Prad (0-1)
6. Ian (0-1)
7. Mike (1-0)
8. Joey (0-1)

## Summary

Savan starts off the season with an incredible performance from the Cowboys D/ST putting up 35 points. This
win extends his dominant run against Neil to 11-0 All-Time, 7-0 in the Stonks Era. Overall, Savan had a
great game all-around the board and his only issues were Jalen Hurts, George Kittle, and Rachaad White
underperformances. If his players can get it together next week, he should be putting up consistently
dominant performances just like this one every week. Neil on the other hand needs a healthy Mark Andrews and
Joe Burrow to get the Bengals offense together, overall still a lot of promise on his team which is why he
is ranked 4 despite a brutal loss against his "father".

Some teams have very little to look forward to, like Mike and Joey. Mike is dealing with 2 star players on IR,
while Joey had embarassing numbers across the board from all of his players. Both teams need to stay diligent
on waivers if they want to see success, and I still believe when Mike gets Kupp and JT back he will be a force
starting Week 5.

Sam had a very solid outing, we knew his main problem going in was Kyle Pitts and we were not wrong. A very 
lackluster performance from Josh Allen also brought his score down but it did not matter as his opponent
Prad did not have Travis Kelce in. Regardless of Travis Kelce's health, I believe Prad would have lost this
game anyway. He had a donut from Drake London and even if he had Kelce he would've needed 30 to compete.
The loss of Aaron Rodgers does not help the Garrett Wilson pick and I think overall, this might be the beginning
of the end of Prad's dynasty as his team just seems overall mid. If Sam can tie up the loose end that is Pitts
I'm sure he'll have a great season going forward.

In an absolute nailbiter, Ishan edges out Ian by 0.6 points despite having 2 players with donuts. Had the Cowboys
not immediately gotten off to a hot start and go on to beat the Giants 40-0, Saquon may have gotten more touches
and surpassed the 9.9 fantasy points that Ian needed to win. Overall, Ishan's team performed great and with two
players not recording a single stat, they still have enough of a presence on their teams to bounce back and hopefully
tie up the loose ends. Ian's team was not terrible either, however Fields had a rough game against the Packers and his
FLEX plays were very underwhelming. The bright spot is Calvin Ridley is more than back, and his performance gives hope
that he will be dominant and a top receiver for Trevor Lawrence. Ian should bounce back but has started off the season
once again as the most mid team and the win margin shows how his luck has fallen these past few years.

## Week 2 Matchup Predictions

Ishan beats Neil

Savan beats Prad

Ian beats Joey

Sam beats Mike

## Notes

* Players that were out this week: Cooper Kupp, Jonathan Taylor, Travis Kelce, Mark Andrews
* Aaron Rodgers and JK Dobbins tear their achilles in their Week 1 Games
* The only game closer than Ishan vs Ian at 0.6 points is Joey vs Ian in 2021 Week 7. Joey had 154.44 and Ian had 154.16 losing by 0.28.
