## Summary

Well, I want to get this out as soon as I can but most of these matchups are going to be decided by the Eagles-Falcons game. So I decided I'm going
to switch it up. Let's talk about the history of our league for a second. Started with 16 people in 2016, also known as Savan's Mickey Mouse Championship Season.
Oh Savan, how far you've fallen. It's really just been downhill from there hasn't it? Your biggest highlights have been sending the same screenshot 1000 times,  
beating Neil countless times only to lose when the lights are brightest, and getting c*** blocked by Gorlock the Destroyer. That last one isn't fantasy
related but having a girlfriend is still in his fantasies...

The next 3 years weren't anything special. Dom, Garrett, and Ian McCarthy won the league (and fun fact are the only white people to do so in our history).
Then the official Stonks Era begun. We let Prad win, somehow ahead of his time drafting tight ends early. This dude got out of control drafting 3 tight ends
a year, and now at his lowest seasons is still reminiscing on his glory days. "I'm going back to my roots" - Prad during the draft. Continued to draft THE SAME
TEAM. EVERY. SINGLE. YEAR. And I don't think it's working.

Sam just casually won one. TBH I don't remember anything from that season other than he was a James Conner merchant. How tf did we let a Kyle Pitts team win? I
guess Tight End doesn't matter because you didn't even sub one in this week. Bro got reminded that Engram was out but overslept the good sportsmanship anyway.

Then this MF NEIL comes out the woodworks with the WORST RECORD IN FANTASY to win back-to-back. He drafts for playoffs, doesn't do shit in the regular season,
his fantasy philosophy is basically the same as when he said "I make $50/hr sitting on my ass." I guess you got to give him credit for staying true to his character.
Neil luck is real though. His attention to his lineup is as absent as his commitment to showing up to a Stonks event on time, with playoffs being the courts exception.
Also I said it once and I'll say it again. STOP F---ING USING EXTRA LETTERS ON YOUR PLAYERS NAMES! NOBODY WANTS TO SEE YOU SAY DIIIGGGGSSSSS 20 SEASONS IN A ROW. We know
you're the only person in the world that would let Stefon Diggs date his sister (if you even had one, I guess Sheil).

Now you're probably wondering what makes Ishan qualified to talk shit about the former champions? The answer is, the model said so + IDGAF + L + ratio. As a
seasoned regular season merchant and clinical playoff choker, I can safely say I know a losing team when I see one. I mean, as I'm typing this I'm 8th in the
rankings (would be 7th if I didn't tank) and I started Likely and benched MHJ this week. Now, if I lose I still look like I'm tanking and y'all are going to say,
"All that arguing for 4 points?" "Get ready to run a beer mile buddy" "Spreadsheet boi 2.0", which is fine by me. But if I win this week, HAHA get f---ed I nerfed
myself and STILL WON. Prad thought he got in my head but really I just wanted to start Likely in spite of his b----ass and I benched MHJ because I wanted to wait for
Kyler to do more in the offense, so Conner was a safe bet and Engram was out so I thought Brian Thomas Jr would do more. "He's coping, he didn't really think that"
BOO-f***ing-HOO I won and you're mad. (Editor's Note: If I lose this section only gets more comical)

All this talk about champions is tiring, what about the rivalries? Prad and Joey was a big one in the early Stonks Era. Joey was/has usually been a top
contender for the crown, it's been an absolute shame he hasn't won one yet. At his peak, the only thing stopping him was the tight end merchant and his players
facing jail time. He's owned Kamara, Aaron Jones, Tyreek, Darren Waller, all players with some questionable history. This year is no different as he's brought
back 3/4 of his legacy players for another run at it. This year might be the year though, because they've been popping off. A couple injuries are hindering him,
but overall if I were to bet on this rivalry, I'd say Joey's legacy team clears Prad's copy-paste team.

On the other end of rivalries, we have Mike and Ian. Which has been pretty quiet ngl. I think we chalked this rivalry up as "they're both white and went to
UMD." They've also been generationally mid and injury plagued. Match made in heaven? Who knows. But they're starting off hot this season, and flipping the script 
could be in the books this year. I want to say more about their history but they really don't have any. In fact, Mike didn't join the league until 2018. So,
despite being known for his injury plagued seasons, Ian's run of luck is far more impressive. Ian's never finished higher than 5th except for an outstanding season
in 2022! Where he finished 4th. Enough beating Ian while he's down though, he's still never had a loser season... but Mike has! Twice! 
However, Mike never paid his dues in 2018. Partially because punishments didn't actually start until 2020. But he ran his beer mile this year, which seems kind of weak
considering he's one of the most fit people in our group. Maybe Mike redoing 1.5 punishments should be in next year's rules proposals?!?! I doubt either of these
teams will be in consideration for the Toilet Bowl this year though (I hope this is an All-Time jinx).

Alright enough yapping let's see the outcomes of this week. Mike won, Joey won. *YAWN* PRAD LOST, HAHAHAHAHAHAHA. FRAUDHYUM. BROS WASHED. ALSO I WON. TANKING WORKS.
PUT A F---ING ASTERIKS ON MY SEASON IN YOUR HEAD. I BEND THIS LEAGUE TO MY WILL. YOU'RE ALL GETTING MANIPULATED AND ROBBED.
