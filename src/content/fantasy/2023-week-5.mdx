## Rankings: Ishan's Version

1. Sam (4-1) ↑3
2. Savan (3-2) ↑1
3. Neil (4-1) ↓2
4. Ishan (3-2) ↓2
5. Ian (0-5) —
6. Joey (3-2) ↑1
7. Prad (1-4) ↑1
8. Mike (0-5) ↓2

## Summary

I shook up the rankings, Joey destroys Ishan with a Ja'Marr 50 bomb after his comment, "at least I play Mike and Joey next."
The seemingly top 2 teams had a close matchup with Sam coming out on top over Savan, both consistent and both dominant should be in
for some easier matchups in the upcoming schedule. The bottom 2 teams standings wise faced off as well, Prad adding fuel to Ian's
bad luck by dropping 200+ and making the matchup nowhere as easy as we thought it would be. Neil and Mike faced off, but Mike showed
exactly why the algorithm hates him by dropping a dud 91. Overall, the teams feel a lot closer than the standings show as Ian and Prad
are actually competitive but have had some bad luck, and Sam, Savan, Neil are showing out these initial first weeks and aren't showing
signs of slowing down. Ishan is now at his hardest part of his schedule and will probably drop significantly, falling into the pretender
category with Mike. Joey is good, his team will fight upwards but I think he fits the underdog role well.

## Week 6 Matchup Predictions

Ishan +138 / 42.87% - 58.13% / -132 Sam [My Pick]

[My Pick] Prad -205 / 68.56% - 32.44% / +215 Mike

Neil -108 / 52.99% - 48.01% / +112 Joey [My Pick]

[My Pick] Savan -213 / 69.37% - 31.63% / +223 Ian
