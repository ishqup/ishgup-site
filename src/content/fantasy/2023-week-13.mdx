6. Prad
7. Mike

## Summary

1 more week till playoffs, our Toilet Bowl matchup is pretty much set unless a miracle happens. Mike beats Prad in a brutal matchup between the
lowest scorers of the league. Prad loses playoff hopes with Tank Dell going down and Mike was already a goner but it's gotta hurt even more losing
to last place. L Prad, if me typing this automatically sends me karma and I don't win the championship, it was still worth it.

Ishan lost to Sam, both teams weren't at full strength but still a competitive game. Sam handed me an a** whooping for talking trash. Sam's team is
so good, underdog for sure. Probably the elmo jacket, even Taylor Swift had to steal his style.

Neil beat Joey but it was a lot closer than expected. Joey could've won in many ways but ultimately fell short by 1 point. DK sat on his bench with 
a solid 37 points which was very unfortunate. Neil is ending this season off hot and is showing signs of going for back-to-back chips.

Savan beat Ian and it wasn't really close. Ian is going to have to make sure to win against Mike to secure his playoff spot but is still sitting
comfortably in terms of Points For. Savan you're trash btw, I'm going to beat you next week.

## Week 14 Matchup Predictions

[My Pick] Ishan +109 / 48.78% - 52.22% / -105 Savan

Sam +125 / 45.37% - 55.63% / -120 Neil [My Pick]

Prad +155 / 39.96% - 61.04% / -149 Joey [My Pick]

[My Pick] Ian -356 / 79.66% - 21.34% / +378 Mike

## Notes

* Had Trevor Lawrence not gotten injured or if Ja'Marr/Engram had gotten another catch, Joey would've beaten Neil
* Had Prad not made the Tank and Waddle for Achane and Hockenson trade, Prad would've started McBride and Achane to have 38 more points to exactly tie Mike
