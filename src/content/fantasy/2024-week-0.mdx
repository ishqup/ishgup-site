## Mock Draft

|     | 1. Mike             | 2. Neil          | 3. Joey         | 4. Ishan         | 5. Ian        | 6. Prad         | 7. Savan        | 8. Sam          |
|-----|---------------------|------------------|-----------------|------------------|-------------- |-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| R1  | C.McCaffrey         | T.Hill           | C.Lamb          | A.St.Brown       | B.Hall        | J.Chase         | B.Robinson      | A.Brown         |
| R2  | D.Adams             | D.Achane         | G.Wilson        | K.Williams       | P.Nacua       | S.Barkley       | J.Jefferson     | J.Gibbs         |


This year's draft feels very uncertain beyond the first 3 picks, by pick 6 (Prad) I'm pretty much going in blind. I see Jefferson dropping just
because JJ McCarthy is his QB, so despite being WR1 it doesn't feel that secure of a pick as it was with Kirk. AJ and Gibbs just give me Sam vibes,
so I'm rockin' with it. I feel like I also did Ian dirty, but you gotta admit they're pretty Ian-esque picks to make with Breece and Puka. I don't
think Joey is rocking with Garrett Wilson, but he's a high upside pick. Achane is also a high upside pick, although the rankings say he's a reach but
with Tyreek I think the Dolphins stack would be valid for Neil.

|     | 1. Mike             | 2. Neil          | 3. Joey         | 4. Ishan         | 5. Ian        | 6. Prad         | 7. Savan        | 8. Sam          |
|-----|---------------------|------------------|-----------------|------------------|-------------- |-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| R1  | T.Hill              | C.Lamb           | C.McCaffrey     | A.St.Brown       | J.Chase       | B.Robinson      | A.Brown         | B.Hall          |
| R2  | G.Wilson            | D.Achane         | P.Nacua         | K.Williams       | S.Barkley     | S.LaPorta       | J.Gibbs         | J.Jefferson     |

In an alternate universe, I could also see this draft occuring. I think it might be a combination of both mocks I created in certain aspects. 
In reality, it's probably gonna pan out nothing like I anticipate. However, I hope you enjoy watching me crumble as I speculate and get excited
just to fall short of a championship yet again. Not even a spreadsheet can save my team from choking. Also, Savan you're dogwater.

## Notes

* Prad has drafted Kelce in the following rounds: 2021 1st, 2022 2nd, 2023 1st
* Kelce is now being projected around the 3rd round and is the 2nd TE off the board in some rankings behind Sam LaPorta, will this be the first draft Prad strays from his glorious king?
