## Rankings: Ishan's Version

1. Joey (5-2) —
2. Ian (4-3) ↑1
3. Mike (3-4) ↓1
4. Sam (4-3) —
5. Ishan (2-5) ↑1
6. Savan (4-3) ↑1
7. Neil (1-6) ↓2
8. I'm never ranking you higher than this unless you make it to 1 in the ESPN standings (You're 30 points away, PF counts) —

## Summary

Savan basically let himself get fathered this past week. There's a reason his baby photo is my contact picture for him. Get sonned buddy.
With rivalry week over, let's review the current records between our rivals:

Ishan 5 - 4 Savan

Ian 5 - 4 Mike

Sam 6 - 3 Neil

Prad 6 - 3 Joey

Ian has now beat Mike 3 rivalry weeks in a row, completing the comeback and taking the lead. Sam and Prad have also beat their rivals 3 times
in a row, solidifying their leads against Neil and Joey and making them feel like Embiid... "This is not a rivalry, they always kick our ass."
Seems like me and Savan are the only ones keeping the competition alive. Although, in terms of overall performance this season, Prad and Joey
seem like the rivalry to watch.

In fact, with Prad and Joey tied for first and having just early voted myself. Let's compare the league to the 2024 Election... With the obvious
first comparison of Prad and Trump. My guy wants to "Make Stonks Fantasy Football Great Again." From his views on tanking being like illegal
immigrants crossing the border, to talking about his tight ends like it's his golf game... Travis Kelce is like his handicap, used to be very good
but he still can't admit that it's washed now. Let's not forget the cheating allegations, it's like they're the same person with Trump trying to stop
the count and Prad trying to act all noble and by the book except that book is the dynasty rule book in redraft. Unrelated to the league, Prad's betting
habits are almost as wild as saying "They're eating the CATS! They're eating the DOGS!!" After all his shit, I hope I can put Prad's face photoshopped
on Trump putting the fries in the bag.

Now before we even get to Kamala, we gotta talk about Sleepy Joe. I would've loved for Biden to align with Joey so I could've called him Sleepy Joey,
but let's be real... The fall off for Joe was about as quick as the fall off for Mike's team. Early in our 2024 season, watching Mike's team pop off
was like reminscing on when Biden could actually formulate sentences. Even with injuries, Mike's team seemed like a true championship candidate. It
took a little before the health problems got to Joe and Mike that they just had to be replaced. Unfortunately, Mike's team fell down the Air Force One
stairs.

To replace Biden, we got Kamala. I don't think there's anyone more fitting to be Kamala than the team who's named "White Dudes for Kamara."
Joey has been a favorite all season to win the championship, I mean he's been winning week after week with much ease. Joey winning a championship
is like the United States awaiting the first woman president. He's had successful seasons but hasn't finished like Hillary, it's been long awaited,
and Joey's championship history is like Kamala's book of acheivements... empty. Also, let's not forget their sidekicks. Brian is like Tim Walz, his
ownership and commitment to saying "our team" is almost as real as Walz's merit in the United States military... It's just not. BUT. You can't help
but root for those two silly guys, I mean Walz has shown love for the Timberwolves and Naz Reid, and that's no different than Brian smashing the 
taunt button every week for Joey. Although you may not love Kamala or another team winning the stonks championship, if it's not gonna be your team,
you can't help but show your support to them.

With the main race out of the way, lets get to the side characters. Neil is Mark Robinson, complete and utter trash. His history in the woods and with
underage girls is like Robinson's gooning going public. Forever the enemy, I don't know how each of them have been in a position of power. Ian's like
Pete Buttigeg, a great lovable candidate. However, the lingering United States homophobia may keep him out of office like injuries linger and prevent Ian
from going far in the playoffs. Savan is Vivek Ramaswamy they way he let me shit talk him on the Week 6 power rankings. It was like I was Ann Coulter saying
I won't vote for him because he's brown, and he just took it without fighting back. Sam is me joking that I'm writing in Billy Edwards Jr. into my ballot.
Billy Edwards clutched up in the Maryland game like Sam clutched beating Neil to get me out of last place, but nobody expects him to be a real threat come
playoff time.

As for me? I'm the media (CNN, FOX News). Prad's gonna say the post is wack like Trump calls everything fake news. I'm biased and unreliable just like the media. But,
you're still going to come read me for the latest scoop. Ultimately, you'll form your own opinions and some of the stuff I type will subconciously sway
you one way or another anyway.

## HOT-TAKE-BIT

He has homework to finish.
