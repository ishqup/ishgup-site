## Rankings: Ishan's Version

1. Savan (2-0) —
2. Neil (1-1) ↑2
3. Ishan (1-1) ↓1
4. Sam (2-0) ↓1
5. Prad (0-2) —
6. Ian (0-2) —
7. Joey (1-1) ↑1
8. Mike (1-1) ↓1

## Summary

Savan with a repeat dominant performance, with pretty much nothing to complain about. Prad however needs to get his running backs
together, but with Kyren on his bench and a hopeful comeback game from Etienne there should be no reason for extreme worry.

Brutal loss for Ian once again, losing on a fumble six touchdown by TJ Watt to lose his game by 3. This is the second time Joey has
won on a defensive comeback. The first time was by Jourdan Lewis on the Cowboys. Ian's team is consistent and mid, but should pull together
a couple wins once luck is on his side. Joey has a lot to improve on despite pulling out this win as his only bright spots were Lamar and 
Evans.

Neil pulls out a solid win despite a donut from the Broncos Defense. However, this game could've ended differently had Rhamondre not scored
a practically garbage time TD (I'm just salty). Ishan's team once again put up solid numbers but unfortunately faced the second highest
scorer this week.

The two lowest scorers faced off in a toilet bowl match. Sam pulled out the win despite a huge loss of Chubb breaking his leg and being carted
out of the game. Sam will look to replace Chubb who was a critical piece in his lineup. Mike on the other hand is still playing the waiting
game as his team remains on IR, I still believe in it but for now he will stay at the bottom of my rankings.

## Week 3 Matchup Predictions

Ishan beats Prad

Savan beats Mike

Neil beats Ian

Joey beats Sam

## Notes

* Players that were out this week: Cooper Kupp, Jonathan Taylor, Aaron Jones, Austin Ekeler
* Chubb snaps his leg, Davante and Waddle head into concussion protocol
* Ian's team stays being mid :/
