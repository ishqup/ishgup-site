## Rankings: Ishan's Version

1. Joey (4-1) —
2. Mike (3-2) —
3. Savan (4-1) ↑1
4. Ian (2-3) ↓1
5. Sam (2-3) —
6. Neil (1-4) ↑1
7. Dumb Short Fucking Moron (1-4) ↓1
8. I'm never ranking you higher than this unless you make it to 1 in the ESPN standings —

## Summary

2023: Ian (0-5) Finished 6th (6-8)

2022: Neil (1-4) Finished 6th & Won Chip (5-9), Sam Finished 8th (2-12)

2021: Ishan (1-4) Finished 6th (6-8)

2020: Neil (1-4) Finished 6th (5-8), Mike (1-4) Finished 7th (5-8), Savan (1-4) Finished 8th (4-9)

These are the worst starts in our league after the first 5 weeks. I'm glad I could make an appearance twice! (I'm fuming)

On the brightside, 4/7 teams escaped the toilet bowl and made the playoffs. One of them even won the entire league. The odds of that happening
are pretty fucking low though. The spectrum ranges from champion in Neil, to last place and a spicy gummy bear in Savan, or more reasonably an
all-time (supposedly hard to break) worst record 2-12 but narrowly escape punishment in the toilet bowl. My odds aren't great. My decisions this
season haven't been any better. I could've started Jakobi over Olave... I could've not gotten a tattoo that I will now be spending the next 1.5 years
lasering off...

To address that last comment, I got fucked up this weekend on my right leg. Just know that even after spending 6 hours on drawing and designing the tattoo
with the artist before it even gets on your leg, the concept you tried to make can still get fucked up and look like shit. Yes, I did my research on the artist.
No, I can't give you a picture of the original drawing because it was done on his iPad and for copyright reasons they never release the designs (Trust me, I asked).
You will probably be asking for a picture of the tat, or next time you see me, try to see it in person. To which I say, you're gonna have to 
[A. kill me] [B. skin me alive] [C. rip my pants off] [D. Look at me Naked? Which would mean you watch me shower?]. If you choose option C, I will then say, I've already 
bought compression leg sleeves so you'll have to rip those off as well, in which case I will sue you for assault and bet it all on Noah Gray Anytime TD. 
This mistake is gonna be covered up as well as the screenshot of what I said about Savan's mom. However, I will add one incentive for giving me some peace as 
I contemplate all my life decisions. If you screenshot and/or remember this article which will stay up as long as the website is alive, which I hope is for a long while.
The following is a legally binding contract as soon as I, Ishan Gupta, commit this article to my github repository:

During the 2029 Stonks Draft, I will release the picture of my shit tattoo. If I decline to do so or conveniently lose the photo of the tattoo, I will forfeit my 1st
round draft pick and draft a Nathan Peterman equivalent. The only stipulations are [1. The Stonks Fantasy Football League has to stay alive. A league ending "replace me"
will ultimately void this contract.] [2. Savan is not allowed to lose his virginity before 2026 or else the photo will be deleted.] [3. Stipulation 2 was a joke, but imagine
if he held out just to see a photo] If the Nathan Peterman equivalent is not enough of a punishment for losing this photo, the league may choose to assign a reasonably worse
punishment in replacement.

Alright, enough of that announthement. Prad's team hit the first 200 bomb of the season. They actually didn't but he was damn near close after being shit all
the weeks prior. So I guess he's actually good and I should stop shit talking him. I'd like to pay reparations for my actions so far this season. I think it's needed
given all the tanking, cheating, shit talking, and gross team management. So, here's my next contract:

If I am not the last place finisher, I will still run the beer mile and try to beat whoever is actually running it. If I am the last place finisher, I will also
eat the Savan Gummy Bear OR the Hottest Chip in the world. The spicy food is up to the league's choosing. These punishments would not occur the same day to avoid
health implications.

Not what you were expecting this week for power rankings I'm sure. Me neither. But I can't take this back like I did when I asked for 20 likes to ask Ariana out.
Do with this article as you will. Screenshot it, copy paste it in a vault. Print it out and make me sign it physically if you want.

## HOT-TAKE-BIT

His lawyers have advised him not to comment on this matter.

## Notes

* Ishan is trash
* Funny enough this article was written a day after I started drafting up my Power of Attorney with a lawyer, which is prob why that's this week's format in Power Rankings
