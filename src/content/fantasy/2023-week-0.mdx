## Rankings

<PowerRankingTable client:load data={frontmatter.prData} />

Disclaimer: It is very hard to actually rank these teams and even though the grades seem far apart, it is always very hard and biased
decisions that determine whether a team is better or worse than another. The teams are always super close and sleeper picks are where
teams really separate themselves during the season.

## Neil (A-)

| Position | Player | Strengths | Weaknesses |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| QB | J. Burrow | WR,TE | FLEX |
| RB | D. Henry |  |  |
| RB | R. Stevenson |  |  |
| WR | J. Jefferson |  |  |
| WR | C. Lamb |  |  |
| TE | M. Andrews |  |  |
| FLEX | K. Walker |  |  |
| FLEX | C. Akers |  |  |

This team is so well assembled I actually question whether Neil actually drafted it or not. Burrow will be a solid QB as long as 
his calf is not an issue during the season. The core of Jefferson, Lamb, Henry, and Andrews is very strong and leaves very little
to critique. Hopefully Rhamondre will pan out with the addition of Zeke, there is no doubt he will get the carries but will he have
the TDs to produce a monster season this year? The FLEX is my main concern, Walker should be fine depending on how involved Charbonnet
is in the backfield and Akers is on an offense with a lot of question marks as they were extremely bad/injured last season. Overall, 
this team should produce well and Neil could be looking to win back-to-back.

## Sam (B+)

| Position | Player | Strengths | Weaknesses |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| QB | J. Allen | QB,RB | TE |
| RB | C. McCaffrey |  |  |
| RB | N. Chubb |  |  |
| WR | A. Brown |  |  |
| WR | C. Godwin |  |  |
| TE | K. Pitts |  |  |
| FLEX | J. Mixon |  |  |
| FLEX | D. Hopkins |  |  |

Every time I rank Sam high I feel like he lets down during the regular season. Time to do it again! I love the solid core of Allen, CMC, 
Chubb, and Brown. Despite the negative outlook on Mixon, I feel like he fell too far and he is definitely a value where he was picked.
I think where this team has the most question marks is with Godwin, Hopkins, and Pitts. Although historically Godwin and Hopkins have been
elite the change in QB/location makes me wonder how effective they will end up being. Pitts has had terrible seasons despite all the hype
around him so I hope he turns it around but that is the biggest weakness of this team right now.

## Mike (B+)

| Position | Player | Strengths | Weaknesses |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| QB | T. Lawrence | ALL | INJURY |
| RB | T. Pollard |  |  |
| RB | J. Taylor |  |  |
| WR | C. Kupp |  |  |
| WR | C. Olave |  |  |
| TE | D. Waller |  |  |
| FLEX | D. Samuel |  |  |
| FLEX | A. Cooper |  |  |

I believe Mike's biggest downfall is his ability to manage his team during the season. I do worry about the injuries of Taylor and Kupp
but if this team stays healthy I see very few things wrong with it. I am curious about how well Waller will do in New York but there isn't
much to critique about this team. The ceiling seems like it could be very high and the only reason I did not rank this team higher is due
to injury concerns and management, so if the team crumbles I could see them being just as likely to end up middle of the pack.

## Joey (B)

| Position | Player | Strengths | Weaknesses |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| QB | L. Jackson | WR | TE |
| RB | J. Jacobs |  |  |
| RB | D. Pierce |  |  |
| WR | J. Chase |  |  |
| WR | A. St. Brown |  |  |
| TE | E. Engram |  |  |
| FLEX | D. Metcalf |  |  |
| FLEX | M. Evans |  |  |

This team has a beautiful receiving core in Chase, St. Brown, Metcalf, and Evans. Lamar and Jacobs are very solid as well. The points of
concern on my end is whether Engram will produce like he did at the end of last season for the entire season. A majority of that top 5
finish was due to a small sample of boom games. A lesser concern is the QB situation for Evans and if he will continue to do as well as 
he has in the past. Dameon Pierce should be solid on a lackluster offense and should be consistent, but not the best RB2 to have.

## Ishan (B)

| Position | Player | Strengths | Weaknesses |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| QB | J. Herbert | WR | RB |
| RB | J. Conner |  |  |
| RB | A. Mattison |  |  |
| WR | T. Hill |  |  |
| WR | D. Adams |  |  |
| TE | D. Goedert |  |  |
| FLEX | J. Waddle |  |  |
| FLEX | T. Higgins |  |  |

Very bold draft strategy to go 0 RB for the first four rounds. The stack of Tyreek and Waddle may be a little strange and is very dependent
on the health of Tua, but both finished in the top 8 last season. They may not replicate that but a result that has them both finishing in
the top 15-20 WRs along with Davante and Higgins is a very intriguing prospect. Herbert should be great even as the 7th QB off the board, 
but the weaknesses come at the RB position. Conner as RB1 may be the worst in the league and he has yet to play a full season in his career,
regardless he has been dependable when healthy and Sam can attest. Mattison seems like a value Dalvin Cook and should be promising but we 
will have to wait and see. Goedert is solid but has to fight for targets against Brown and Smith in a lethal offense.

## Prad (B-)

| Position | Player | Strengths | Weaknesses |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| QB | P. Mahomes | QB,TE | MID |
| RB | T. Etienne |  |  |
| RB | N. Harris |  |  |
| WR | G. Wilson |  |  |
| WR | D. Moore |  |  |
| TE | T. Kelce |  |  |
| FLEX | T. Hockenson |  |  |
| FLEX | D. London |  |  |

I actually like this team a bit despite ranking it so low. I have always ranked Prad's strategy poorly and while he has proved me wrong before
there is still part of me that believes this is the year of the downfall. The core of Kelce, Mahomes, and Wilson is very likable but Mahomes
was a sixth round pick last season and with him being taken in the third concerns me as it could've been more valuable to pick a different
position. I don't hate the other players and there is a lot of upside which has always been a common theme in Prad's teams. They just seem
a little too underwhelming to make me think they could out produce the teams I have above him. I might get proven wrong once again, but I will
stand firm as a non-believer.

## Savan (B-)

| Position | Player | Strengths | Weaknesses |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| QB | J. Hurts | QB,RB | FLEX |
| RB | B. Robinson |  |  |
| RB | A. Jones |  |  |
| WR | S. Diggs |  |  |
| WR | D. Smith |  |  |
| TE | G. Kittle |  |  |
| FLEX | R. White |  |  |
| FLEX | C. Watson |  |  |

We all felt a little shock when Savan picked Bijan at the 5 spot, however it is a very fitting pick for the Spreadsheet Boy. I also really
liked this team's core with Bijan, Diggs, and Hurts. I think Devonta was a reach and there were better picks in DK, Waddle, Higgins, and others
at that point in the draft. FLEX is underwhelming but has huge upside as long as they pan out. A theme with the grades I am seeing are that
higher ranked teams have established players with specific concerns that could only make them worse but lower ranked teams have opportunity that
needs to hit and produce well in order to rise in the standings. This team fits that opportunity characteristic very well, as long as Kittle
can get more receiving despite being a great blocker, Dillon doesn't take away opportunity from Jones, Watson establishes himself, White can be
the sole runner of the Bucs, and Devonta takes a step forward from last season. For a very mid looking team, I can see the appeal and the potential.

## Ian (C+)

| Position | Player | Strengths | Weaknesses |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| QB | J. Fields | QB,RB | WR,TE |
| RB | A. Ekeler |  |  |
| RB | S. Barkley |  |  |
| WR | C. Ridley |  |  |
| WR | K. Allen |  |  |
| TE | P. Freiermuth |  |  |
| FLEX | J. Gibbs |  |  |
| FLEX | D. Johnson |  |  |

Very strong start to the draft soon turned into too many reach picks. Fields, Ekeler, Saquon, and Gibbs are my favorite parts of this team and
make this core very strong. Again, a lot of this team comes down to opportunity and whether or not they outperform expectations. Ridley is an 
amazing receiver and hopefully the camp highlights translate to regular season games after his two year hiatus. Keenan, Diontae, and Pat worry
me the most due to age and the Steelers offense needing to take a step forward this season. I genuinely love all of the players on this team but
with how early some of them were taken it feels like Ian will have to rely heavily on a lot of their upside panning out.
