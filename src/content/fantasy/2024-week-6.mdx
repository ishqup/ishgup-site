## Summary

Oh Savan... sorry you've been so neglected this year. Prad's been an attention seeking whore and I've left you without a true partner in this league.
Someone to talk shit to, someone to instigate screenshot sending, someone to love. 

(The answer is nothing Savan. Nothing will make me give away Jordan Love)

(Same goes for you Prad, stop tryna touch my Chubb.)

Since we're approaching rivalry week, it's only fair you finally get some attention from me. Since we're on the topic of love, let's talk about relationships,
family. LETS GET PERSONAL SHALL WE?!

First, don't you dare speak on my mother (8th grade). I'm lucky that the records of your mother have been erased, but one day... one day I will unleash what I said about her
to you again (probably at your funeral). I'm going to pour one out on your grave and recite the forbidden words as I emote take the L (I know you're Indian, so if you're
cremated I'll still do the same to your ashes before they're scattered). Unless of course... we're not invited.

FRIENDS AND FAMILY. I didn't know you were cousins with Jack Norris, siblings with Anshu, and had absolutely no intentions of inviting us to your first grad party.
It only took clowning you for 4 years in college to invite us to your college grad party (Thank you though, we got to see Mike having Indian food). Not only that,
you had to give us an aNnoUnTHeMeNT, "GUYTH, AI'M NAWT goWING 2 OHIO, I WILL PWOBABLY GET SHOT." Thank god you didn't die though, but you still got bodied in
basketball and tore a ligament we never heard of. MPFL? My P---s Fel Loff? Well I'm sure it probably did because, how you go 4 years and still no default dance my guy. 

You said you want to know what (Jordan) Love is? Get some B----ES pussy. Bro told us he got c---blocked by Gorlock the Destroyer. He also had his hands in his pocket
for cotil. BTW, y'all thought he was gonna get with Angie after she ghosted me. I have the screenshot of her saying she only talked to Savan so she could eventually start talking to me again.
She apologized on December 9, 2020 (I have a screenshot that I shared with Mike, Brian, and Joey freshman year, it's not that deep lmao but if you want to see it all you).

Maybe I'm getting too personal, well let's talk shit about Fantasy then. Haha, I stole your spreadsheet boi title... wait that's not good for me. Haha, your dumbass has a worse
record in the regular season all-time... wait, but he's got a championship? But that's mickey mouse it was 2016 and he's living in the past sending that same dumbass screenshot of
the time he beat me by 100... Haha, you've lost the league and had to eat a spicy gummy bear! Wait... but if I lose this year, I have to eat a spicy chip/gummy bear too. Not to
mention I'm 1-5 and he's 4-2... Well, I guess I don't have much ground to stand on... 

But why your dumbass look like the easter island derp face. If you lose this week, you lose to the worst team, lock in ðŸ—¿. Bro's gonna let out a classic deep *SIGH* when his team is down this week.
My fantasy team boutta zip tie your ass to a desk, and make you run in circles you donkey. I may be short but I'm still 7 inches longer because you said "M.P.F.L." All this shit talk, just for him
to send the screenshot again.

I hope this message to Savan from me inspires you to get more personal with your rival...

Mamba out. (I'm gonna get beat 185.92-81.86 again.)

## HOT-TAKE-BIT

I accidentally asked Savan to fill this out instead of Sam. (I'm his teacher and I think they look alike)

## Week 7 Matchup Predictions

Savan -321 / 77.81% - 23.19% / +340 Ishan [My Pick]

Neil +133 / 43.80% - 57.20% / -128 Sam [My Pick]

[My Pick] Joey -176 / 65.08% - 35.92% / +184 Prad

[My Pick] Mike +106 / 49.45% - 51.55% / -102 Ian
