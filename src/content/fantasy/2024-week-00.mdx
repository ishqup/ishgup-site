Disclaimer: It is very hard to actually rank these teams and even though the grades seem far apart, it is always very hard and biased
decisions that determine whether a team is better or worse than another. The teams are always super close and sleeper picks are where
teams really separate themselves during the season.

## Mike (A-)

| Position | Player | Strengths | Weaknesses |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| QB | J. Hurts | QB,RB,TE | FLEX 1 |
| RB | C. McCaffrey |  |  |
| RB | S. Barkley |  |  |
| WR | P. Nacua |  |  |
| WR | D. Metcalf |  |  |
| TE | T. McBride |  |  |
| FLEX | M. Nabers |  |  |
| FLEX | D. Montgomery |  |  |

Honestly I just feel like the draft fell to him very nicely. Stud QB, CMC, had both Puka and Saquon fall in his lap, and a solid TE.
He got Nabers at a great value too, it's just a matter of if he will pan out. Being a WR in a Daniel Jones offense has not been kind in recent
history, so if his skill is enough to put Mike over the edge I can see a very solid season for this team. Also, Mike is historically bad at managing
his team throughout the season so it could just be his season to fumble.

## Ian (B+)

| Position | Player | Strengths | Weaknesses |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| QB | L. Jackson | RB | FLEX 2 |
| RB | B. Hall |  |  |
| RB | J. Taylor |  |  |
| WR | C. Kupp |  |  |
| WR | D. Moore |  |  |
| TE | D. Kincaid |  |  |
| FLEX | J. Cook |  |  |
| FLEX | D. Johnson |  |  |

Ian came out with a great draft, I've been calling him mid too much and he stepped up and delivered. I will never forgive him for stealing James Cook,
has a star in Breece, and got great values in Kincaid and Kupp. My biggest concern is Diontae, who could pan out if the Panthers get their shit 
together but being in Carolina myself, I have very low expectations from what I'm hearing and seeing. I want this to be his year, can we break the
mid streak?

## Joey (B+)

| Position | Player | Strengths | Weaknesses |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| QB | J. Allen | QB,WR | AGE |
| RB | I. Pacheco |  |  |
| RB | A. Kamara |  |  |
| WR | T. Hill |  |  |
| WR | D. Adams |  |  |
| TE | G. Kittle |  |  |
| FLEX | D. Smith |  |  |
| FLEX | R. Rice |  |  |

Joey always coming out with solid drafts, this one was pretty good but the age is the only worry (and possibly jail time). I don't have many
complaints and honestly could've ranked him higher. However, to me it seems like a high floor, low ceiling team with Tyreek and Rashee being the
players he's going to get the most boom out of. Maybe I'm wrong, we'll see.

## Ishan (B)

| Position | Player | Strengths | Weaknesses |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| QB | D. Prescott | WR | QB |
| RB | J. Gibbs |  |  |
| RB | J. Mixon |  |  |
| WR | A. St. Brown |  |  |
| WR | M. Harrison Jr. |  |  |
| TE | M. Andrews |  |  |
| FLEX | C. Olave |  |  |
| FLEX | D. Samuel Sr. |  |  |

I'm not gonna self glaze. I missed out on James Cook, waited a long time on QB, and drafted Mixon and Andrews in some spots where there may have
been better options. Those were my initial thoughts at least, but I really like my team. 4 great WRs, just have to see how their situations pan
out. MHJ is a rookie in a wide open offense, Olave was drafted super high and I got him at a bargain so as my FLEX I can't complain, and Deebo
could be the leader if the Aiyuk situation doesn't resolve and he possibly gets traded. Andrews wasn't a reach by any means because I drafted him at
ranking, as long as he doesn't get injured he's still usually Lamar's number 1 barring a Zay Flowers takeover. Then again what do I know, I'm 
Spreadsheet Boi 2.0 :/

## Neil (B-)

| Position | Player | Strengths | Weaknesses |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| QB | J. Burrow | RB,TE | FLEX 1&2 |
| RB | T. Etienne Jr. |  |  |
| RB | D. Achane |  |  |
| WR | C. Lamb |  |  |
| WR | D. London |  |  |
| TE | S. LaPorta |  |  |
| FLEX | S. Diggs |  |  |
| FLEX | C. Ridley |  |  |

Hated this guy, who tf do you think you are being the only one not on Discord and balling during the draft. Prad was right to be disappointed in you.
Disgrace. Leaving and joining 100 times. And your draft was shit. At least thats what I wanted to think, but then I took a second look and realized
it's not as bad as I thought. Biggest questions are London, Diggs, and Ridley. Will the Falcons be elite with Kirk (I hope so)? Diggs has always been
great skillwise but how will the depth chart pan out? Will Ridley bet the over on Will Levis TDs and passing yards and rig his way to a solid season?
The answer to the last one is no because Mayo boy fumbled Gia Duddy so hard. Anyways, point is I should've given you an F but this will have to do.

## Prad (B-)

| Position | Player | Strengths | Weaknesses |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| QB | P. Mahomes | QB,TE | FLEX 2 |
| RB | K. Williams |  |  |
| RB | K. Walker III |  |  |
| WR | J. Chase |  |  |
| WR | Z. Flowers |  |  |
| TE | T. Kelce |  |  |
| FLEX | G. Pickens |  |  |
| FLEX | Z. White |  |  |

The same team. Over. And over. And over again... It didn't work last year and I doubt it'll be that much better this year. While I don't think
Zamir is actually a weakness, I do think he's a solid gamble. I just wanted to point out that it could be a huge pick if he has the ceiling I believed
he did prior to the draft. There's nothing the rest of the league doesn't already know about this team though... Let's talk about Sam instead.

## Sam (B-)

| Position | Player | Strengths | Weaknesses |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| QB | A. Richardson | QB,WR | FLEX 2 |
| RB | R. White |  |  |
| RB | D. Henry |  |  |
| WR | A. Brown |  |  |
| WR | J. Jefferson |  |  |
| TE | E. Engram |  |  |
| FLEX | M. Pittman Jr. |  |  |
| FLEX | B. Aiyuk |  |  |

Solid team, I didn't want to rank you this low but it kind of ended up like this. Biggest concern is the obvious Aiyuk situation. If he says
and gets paid this is a solid pick. If he gets traded there's a ton of questions. I'm not the biggest fan of the RBs but I also am? White was
exceptional, I just don't know if the Bucs replicate what they did last season with Baker's offense. Henry has always been a beast, they probably
got him so Lamar didn't have to run it in as much so TDs could be there. The other outcome is he gets hawked anyway and sucks. Engram was also a great
pick with what he did last year, however they added Gabe Davis and the rookie BTJ so targets could get distributed more. Your team is better than
I ranked it so don't take it personal.

## Savan (C+)

| Position | Player | Strengths | Weaknesses |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| QB | C. Stroud | FLEX | RB |
| RB | B. Robinson |  |  |
| RB | J. Jacobs |  |  |
| WR | G. Wilson |  |  |
| WR | N. Collins |  |  |
| TE | J. Ferguson |  |  |
| FLEX | M. Evans |  |  |
| FLEX | J. Waddle |  |  |

It just looks kinda mid tbh. Biggest questions to me are Josh Jacobs and Nico Collins. Jacobs being in a backfield with AJ Dillon while the Packers
have some great receivers to throw to doesn't scream upside to me. Nico Collins competing with Diggs and Tank also confuses me, he's a great WR and
I don't question why you drafted him but I personally fade the Texans until I'm certain of the pecking order. Ferguson was a great pick in a wide open
offense, probably second favorite target after CeeDee. Mike Evans was a great value where you got him. Garrett Wilson with a healthy Rodgers should
produce, but he still hasn't had a season worth the draft capital you spent. To me Garrett Wilson and Olave were similarly being over drafted having
not proven themselves completely. Your team isn't bad either so if it pans out there's great upside, but if it doesn't I feel it could be a stinker
of a year.

## Notes

* Prad picked Kelce for the 4th year in a row, but this time at the 3rd Round which is the lowest he's gone
* Ishan went 8/8 in the mock draft he created, could've went 9/9 but lied to Sam that the mock said Jefferson because he wanted Gibbs
* Yes, if you noticed I did rank the Whites above the Browns. Was that a coincidence? IDK
* Savan STILL did not have a single pick made that was shorter than a minute
* Neil joined and left the draft over 100 times, bruh.
