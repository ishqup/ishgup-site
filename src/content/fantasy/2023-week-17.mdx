## 2023 Draft Order
1. Prad
2. Neil
3. Joey            
4. Sam
5. Savan
6. Ishan
7. Mike
8. Ian

## Summary

Neil won back to back championships, making a historical turnaround from being league loser in 2021 and eating IHOP pancakes. Not only did this win
mark the first ever 2-time champion, but he broke his 0-10 losing streak to Savan in the most important game they've ever matched up in. This erases 
any shit talk that Savan could say towards Neil. Neil had beaten Ishan last year, making Savan and Ishan's rivalry a battle of chokers.

Mike lost to Prad 403.7 - 403.9 in the Toilet Bowl, letting Prad escape a beer mile by 0.2 points. Mike's official beer mile time was 15:44.68, which
was slowed by his drinking times and a slower running pace than he could've ran. Mike is now a 2-time fantasy loser, however his first loss in 2018
we never did a punishment and is outside the Stonks era. Some could consider that fraudulent, just like Savan's 2016 chip. 

## Neil wanted to beat Mike's beer mile to determine draft order, so here are the results:

Neil's Official Time: 13:17.94 | 13:02.94 (+15s for 3 beers w/ unfinished sips)

Joey 13:21 (+4s)

Savan 13:40 (+23s)

Ishan 13:47 (+30s)

Ian 13:52 (+35s)

Neil 13:57 (+40s)

Prad 12:37 (-40s)

Mike 14:07 (+50s)

Sam 14:21 (+1:04)

## Notes
* Past Champions Prad (2020) had the 2nd pick, Sam (2021) had the 3rd pick, Neil (2022) had the 7th pick
* Neil won this year with the 2nd pick, making the 2nd spot seem like a very ideal spot to build a team
* Neil beat Mike's beer mile by 2:26.74
