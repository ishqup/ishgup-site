## Summary

Reigning back-to-back champ Neil still can't get past Savan in the regular season. But does it really matter? Neil's 1 championship win >>> Savan's
11 regular season wins. However, this was a strong performance by Savan. He proved his team doesn't deserve to be ranked last with his only concern 
being the Jake Ferguson injury. Neil on the other hand got carried by the Bears D, with Burrow, London, and Ridley putting up some stinkers. While I
would usually criticize his team with more confidence, Week 1 seemed like preseason for a lot of starters. Once we're more established I'll actually
have some conviction talking about my concerns.

Joey and Mike had a battle, other than the fact CMC was ruled out an hour before. Both the whites seem poised for a solid season, just a matter of time
before CMC and Puka are healthy for Mike. I hope I didn't jinx that... but Mike should be a contender with the right management.

Sam and Ian with easy wins. Great move by Sam to drop 49ers D/ST just to secure Jordan Mason. It was a clear win with no chance of loss, so rightfully
taking advantage of the fact he can get ahead of waivers and pickup CMC's handcuff is huge. Ian was in a battle of mid for most of Sunday but a huge
injury to Puka leaves the window wide open for Kupp to be a major steal of the draft. Both of these teams pray on Mike's downfall, but either way
start the season strong and with huge upside going forward.

Prad's team is so good, it's a miracle he didn't win this week. I love how morally just he is! There's a reason he was called JUSTICEMAN at one point
right? I heard he takes his bad seasons soooo well. To the point where if he's the bottom scorer week 1 and gets outplayed LEGALLY by a leaguemate
who benches his FLEX in a clear loss to get the first waiver spot. He doesn't b**** and moan to the commissioner in private and make a scene in the main
groupchat. Now the player who duped him is no saint :/ because he's a known dirty player who's tried to cheat the league before. Let's recall his grimy
past shall we? In the 2018 season, this scum of the earth bribed Neil Brown (not Brown Neil) $20 to trade him Julio for some scraps. Luckily he was 
caught and the bribe was reversed, with reprecussions such as drafting Nathan Peterman with his 2019 3rd Round pick. Now, with 5-6 years of being clean
he goes back to his dirty little habits!! OH NO, NOT ISAIAH LIKELY! HOW COULD HE! TANKING IS FORBIDDEN, FROWNED UPON, CHEATING!! Prad should be devastated,
as he's set at every position except TIGHT END. His running back Travis Kelce is a true stud and Kyle Pitts is a HOF wide receiver. The only reason he
didn't win is because he didn't start a tight end. Isaiah Likely was a league winner and this slimy snake took him from Prad. The snake admits that this
is dirty, soft, and definitely considered tanking. However, he refuses to admit that it was cheating... because "subbing out a player before they've
played is allowed by the app." What a d***head. The competitive move would've been to let Prad take Isaiah Likely because Mark Andrews proved that he was
competent Week 1. Tanking and taking a player you don't need is ridiculous. [The following statement is sarcasm and cannot be used as proof to reverse any 
league decisions] This was totally a rule that tanking was not allowed in both redraft and dynasty, and that conversation definitely was not exclusive to 
just dynasty because the effects of tanking are the same regardless of league type. I hope Prad teaches this douche who's boss during Week 3 and Week 10. 
Let's hear what Sam has to say about this week...

## HOT-TAKE-BIT

After intense deliberation, Ishan’s brilliant usage of “replace me” secures one of the best players in the NFL, one that is likely to break all TE records. 
2-0

## Week 2 Matchup Predictions

Coming Soon, not enough data.

## Notes

* Ishan subbed out Deebo and is a p***y
* We need a league rule book to keep track of disputes
