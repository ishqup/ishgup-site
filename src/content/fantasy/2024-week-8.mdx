## Summary

This is a Jordan Love Hate Letter.

Dear Jordan,

Stop fucking gooning everywhere. Groin injuries are so fake, these motherfuckers said it was your ankle at first. Then all of a sudden a defensive
player pushes you and you croak over like Sam and drop your FUCKING CHICKEN SANDWICH. I JORDAN HATE YOU. You think I'm gonna pity you and empathize
because of my extensive injury history and multiple groin injuries at courts? FUCK NO. I'M SICK OF YOUR BULLSHIT. AND FUCK YOU TOO SAVAN. Your bitchass
asked me for some Jordan Love only to take it away. I had hope. I won a second game, I was on track for a third, BUT SOMEBODY CURSED MY FUCKING TEAM.
FUCK YOU PRAD. All you had to do was keep tf quiet that my team was popping off, and maybe, just maybe this weak ass bitch Jordan would've survived
the entire game without flopping like a fish and needing to sub in DOGSHIT ASS MALIK WILLIS. After that it was only downhill. Brian Thomas Jr is out
2-4 weeks, Deebo was subbing in and out because his lungs hurt and he got robbed of 2 potential TDs which would've saved my game. 

Now all my hope is on Chris Boswell to score 16 points... HOW FUCKING EASY IS THAT. THE ODDS OF THAT HAPPENING ARE AS MUCH AS THE ODDS OF ME HITTING 
5 FOOT 5!! I'VE BEEN WAITING 22 YEARS FOR THAT EXTRA INCH! "Well you should've just started Olave and MHJ" FUCK YOU. Would you have started a receiver 
who's competing for targets with PITT LEGEND BUB FUCKING MEANS and underperformed atrociously all season while receiving passes from a goofy ass ginger 
lightskin named Spencer? If you say yes you can eat my right nut. Would you have started MHJ who is receiving passes from Kyler after the release of BO6, 
who had a concussion last week, who has had 2 good games all season excluding this current week?? If you say yes you can eat my left nut. Regardless of 
the decisions made in my lineup I still blame it on Jordan Love. Because he can't finish. I hope that representative of his love life not just his ability 
to play, because it's def representative of Neil talking to women. 

ALSO FUCK YOU IAN. ALL ODDS AGAINST YOU AND YOU FUCKED ME OVER ANYWAY. LAST MINUTE EVAN ENGRAM TD (I can't fucking stand this bitch. Butterfingers on
the Giants and while he's on my fantasy team way back when. Only caught one pass up until the 4th quarter because he realized Jordan Love was out and
they actually have a chance to win. AND HE STILL FUCKING LOST. TO MALIK WILLIS. FUCK YOU BITCH.). JOSH DOWNS CAUGHT A TD... SIKE HE'S ON THE 1, LET'S 
HAND IT OFF TO JONATHAN TAYLOR FOR A TD. EVEN DJ MOORE PUTTING UP A SHITTER AND A HALF MAKES A MIRACULOUS 27 YARD CATCH AT THE END OF THE GAME WHILE 
GETTING INJURED AND SOMEHOW HELD ONTO IT. AND DON'T EVEN GET ME STARTED ON HOW SPECIAL NEEDS DAK IS THROWING 2 PICKS TO 49ERS D/ST. AND JAMES COOK,
THE MOTHERFUCKER I DIDN'T DRAFT AND LET IAN TAKE PUTS UP 2 TOUCHDOWNS IN THE SECOND HALF, AFTER HAVING LIKE 5.5 POINTS IN THE FIRST. PUT ME ON SUICIDE
WATCH. I'M SO SICK...

... and all of it is your fault Jordan. You're dropped, we're done. Savan you can take him and help him with his groin problems just like you do in
the backseat of cars with Neil.

Disrespectfully,
Last Place Owner ðŸ–•

This was all written prior to Boswell playing, so even if he does win me the game somehow... All my feelings in this letter still stand.

## HOT-TAKE-BIT
