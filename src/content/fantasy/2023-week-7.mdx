## Rankings: Ishan's Version

*Ishan's Most Scary Teams
1. Prad
2. Neil
3. Joey
4. Sam
5. Savan
6. Ian
7. Mike

## Summary

Savan is so bad, the lights were too bright, and he's been living in the past for 7 years and counting. Ishan comes out with a pretty easy
victory but a disappointing performance from his team. He'll look to bounce back against Ian next week, meanwhile Savan will try to break this
3 game losing streak against Neil.

Ian is finally picking up steam, with a win against Ishan he has come out of last place, and put Mike where he should be. Mike's team has been
nothing but bad since getting a few of his IR players and you wonder whether he'll be able to even compete in the Toilet Bowl. A Beer Mile is 
most definitely in Mike's future. Ian will look to beat Ishan as he continues his climb, while Mike will face off against Joey in hopes of breaking
the dry spell.

Joey and Prad, two teams making huge leaps in the standings lately face off in a competitive matchup. Unfortunately, Prad had the Kelce-Swift power up
allowing a dominant performance this week to come up with a win. Joey will look to bounce back against Mike, while Prad will look to make it to the top
of the rankings against Sam.

Sam and Neil are in a close matchup, either could win it but it's leaning towards Sam at the moment I'm writing this. Both are performing well and
should continue to stay competing for a championship after this week. Sam has a tough matchup against Prad, while Neil will play Savan (trash). Sam
won, Neil is still great so I'm not too concerned about either team.

## Week 8 Matchup Predictions

[My Pick] Prad +117 / 47.12% - 53.88% / -112 Sam

[My Pick] Joey -305 / 76.82% - 24.18% / +322 Mike

[My Pick] Neil -128 / 57.32% - 43.68% / +134 Savan

Ishan -208 / 68.93% - 32.07% / +218 Ian [My Pick]
