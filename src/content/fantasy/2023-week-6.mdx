## Rankings: Ishan's Version

1. Sam (4-2) —
2. Savan (3-3) —
3. Ishan (4-2) ↑1
4. Joey (4-2) ↑2
5. Neil (4-2) ↓2
6. Prad (2-4) ↑1
7. Ian (1-5) ↓2
8. Mike (2-4) —

## Summary

I have to address Mike's PF and PA, I genuinely don't know how he could have 2 wins when it seems like he straight up didn't play 2 games.
Both totals are ~100 points under the next lowest, yet somehow he is still somewhat in contention to stay in the playoffs considering how
close the standings actually are. He lost to Prad, who has finally broken out of the slump and isn't looking to slow down now. If he maintains
this production he should put up a fight against a relatively hard schedule against Joey, Sam, Savan, and Ishan in the next 4 weeks.

Joey took it personal, having beaten 3 of the other 4-2 teams (Sam, Ishan, and Neil) and securing himself in the top 4. I would keep him an
underdog, but he's showing signs of his usual fantasy dominance and will be in contention for the ring that he deserves after coming up short
too many times. Neil on the other hand, not doing terrible but a very underwhelming performance but we all know his luck will come around when
it matters. The loss of Justin Jefferson is devastating though, it will be hard to replace a player of that caliber.

Ian finally did it, it was a long time coming too... Multiple games where he fell short by fractions of a point, a few dud games, and the highest
PA. His luck has not been on his side, give him Mike's schedule though and he's chilling. It will be a grind to make it to playoffs, but with an
easy rivalry week matchup against Mike, the timing couldn't be better for him to make that push. Savan's so trash, talking so much smack and then
losing to the worst record team is embarassing. I hope he can back up his talk during rivalry week.

You know who else is trash, Sam. Bro also talked and failed to perform. Even if he had his best lineup, which it's strange that he started Hopkins
considering his bench options were better, he still would've lost. The Miami Dolphins stack has proved to work so far, with Ishan pulling out an
easy win against what was supposed to be a tough matchup. 

Next week is rivalry week, but apparently every week is "Trash Ishan's Rankings Week". Trash talk will commence, Ishan and Savan haven't stopped since 
Week 14 last year. The matchups are pretty even this year, Sam and Neil are pacing each other, Prad and Joey are coming into the week hot, and
Mike and Ian are both bottom of the league. Should be a week that either separates the good teams from the bad, or makes the league that much more
of a close competition.

## Week 7 Matchup Predictions

[My Pick] Savan +141 / 42.41% - 58.59% / -135 Ishan

Neil +115 / 47.44% - 53.56% / -111 Sam [My Pick]

[My Pick] Joey -105 / 52.31% - 48.69% / +109 Prad

Mike +256 / 28.62% - 72.38% / -244 Ian [My Pick]
