## Summary

Hello class, today we will be discussing how our league's fortnite playstyle translates to fantasy football success. "But Professor Gupta, Savan and Ian
barely get online and play with us!!"

Shut the fuck up.

You wanna know why I've barely talked shit about Savan this year, despite him being my rival? (It's mainly cuz Prad is being an especially large hoe for 
how bad he's doing but ignore that) BECAUSE HE'S IRRELAVENT. THE ONLY GAMING EXPERIENCE WE'VE TRULY SEEN FROM SAVANMANAGE IS GETTING B----ED BY MADDIE
IN COD. SO IT'S NO WONDER HE GOT TAUNTED BY BRIAN, TAUNTED BACK, AND THEN XAVIER WORTHY SCORED A TOUCHDOWN. "But Professor, Savan won his matchup."

Shut the fuck up.

DID YOU NOT HEAR ME?!?! THIS WEEK MADDIE TOOK OVER. HE WASN'T BEING TAUNTED BY BRIAN OR JOEY. MADDIE SET THE LINEUP, MADDIE TAUNTED, AND MADDIE GAVE HIM A 
PITY WIN. JUST. LIKE. LAST. TIME.

And to address Ian, when he does get on Fortnite he's goated. And that's showing in his season this year.

Also, lets address Brian and Joey while Maddie was brought up. Both are a controlled chaos. A sweat's worst nightmare. Joey relaxes with his Prison squad and
hits sneaky rocket launchers that hit hard like the countless Kamara TDs he's scoring this year. And all while Brian sits back for the snipe, shooting a taunt 
at the defenseless opponent. Brian's practically hitting the default dances for Joey at this point, which makes sense becuase they usually team together in private matches.

Now what about the sweats? Specifically Prad. The Barb. Think of his leadership style. Very dictatorship-esque. He prides himself on his skill, almost to a fault.
His acheivements are impressive, don't get me wrong. But it gives him a big head. He can be a good, but when he's leading the squad he blames his teammates and doesn't let
them flow. Take Sam, an untamed beast. You can't tell him where to rotate or what to hold. Now take the Tight End position. Also an untamed beast. Trying to control the 
market is like trying to bet $10 on an exact score parlay to win $228k. He had success once with Kelce and Mahomes, winning a championship. But since then he's been trying to
control his team too much. Not letting it flow. And it's leading to failure. Kelce is washed, Pitts has been hyped and disappointed. It's time to let your draft flow. Don't control
the draft, let it come to you.

Now we talking about vibes teams. And there's nobody who lets it flow more than Sam. Prad can't control him. While Prad was distracted on Likely, Jordan Mason was ripe
for the taking. Now CMC's career might've ended and it slipped away from everyone. But not Sam, because he let it flow. Vibes. That's what makes a great IGL.
Being adaptable. Sometimes his vibes come at the cost of his own team or others. I mean his first two picks were literally not chosen by himself. He chose AJ Brown and Justin
Jefferson because the mock said so. Now AJ Brown is out. What about others? Well...

Mike is fucked. CMC is out. Sam picked up Jordan Mason, so now Mike has no handcuff. It's like when Sam just targets Mike and we can't even leave spawn without Mike getting downed.
Focusing on each other, rather than the real enemy (Prad) just leads to both teams losing. But since Week 1, Sam left Mike alone. No CMC? Don't matter. Mike's gonna cook.
Even the biggest opponent looks like a scrub because he's still gonna drop 170 on anyone's head with none of his starters in. This wouldn't have happened in past seasons. But
this team is built different, injuries don't matter. Just like his health in privates doesn't matter. He gets the job done.

"But professor, what makes you so qualified to make these observations. You suck."

Shut the fuck up.

Fantasy? All-time choker. Regular season merchant. Dallas Cowboys. Green Bay Packers. Can't get the job finished. Fortnite? Private final 2 choker. Up against a bot?
Dead. Up against Prad? Begging for mercy. Finally gets a win? Lowkey Mickey Mouse. So what makes me qualified? Nothing. But you just read a yap sesh about how Fantasy
and Fortnite are related. So take this L. I just wasted your time.

## Notes

* Neil's absence from the main part of the article is symbolism for how irrelavent he's been in fantasy and how absent he's been in our fortnite lobbies as of late
* We got some cool edgy fantasy team names this week: JSNd noods, Put Rashee in Rice
* Frozone skin came to the Item Shop
