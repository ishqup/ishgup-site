*Ishan's Most Scary Teams

1. Joey
2. Neil
3. Savan
4. Prad
5. Ian
6. Sam
7. Mike

## Summary

Sam had all the power to talk sh** to Savan on the blog, but where did it lead him? Straight to an L, not only that Savan took it personally and put 
up 181. Sam has been on a 4 game losing streak now and it's not looking good for him if Prad can sneak in. Sam will have to avoid losing out to manage
a spot in the playoffs.

Prad is on the come up with Kyren back and the first and likely only trade of the season. Ishan and Prad traded Tank Dell and Jaylen Waddle for De'Von 
Achane and TJ Hockenson. Prad greatly improved his flex WRs and beat Ian in a crucial game to keep himself in the playoff hunt. Prad still has to win out
to stay in but his schedule bodes well for him and he should be in great shape to make it happen. Ian on the other hand is another team that needs to win
to stay in the hunt, he will face Mike at the end of the season but will he manage to pull through?

Ishan beats Joey with an unfortunate brutal 1 point performance from Adam Thielen. This game would've been a lot closer and Joey will need to win a game to
secure his spot in the playoffs. He has a history now of losing out the season, so hopefully he can pull something together in the final stretch.

Neil and Mike are still battling as I'm typing this, but a last place beating first place would be an insane game. He needs a solid 11 from the Vikings
Defense, which is attainable but it will be close. Mike has seemingly lost this matchup, it is an unfortunate day for Canada, and therefore the rest of the
world (South Park reference). Neil sucks, Mickey Mouse win.

## Week 13 Matchup Predictions

[My Pick] Sam +112 / 48.16% - 52.84% / -107 Ishan

Mike +214 / 32.46% - 68.54% / -205 Prad [My Pick]

[My Pick] Joey +127 / 44.84% - 56.16% / -122 Neil

Ian +107 / 49.23% - 51.77% / -103 Savan [My Pick]
