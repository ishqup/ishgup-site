## Summary

The teams are set for playoffs, we have Mike and Prad in the Toilet Bowl. Prad had a great win against Joey, unfortunately it is not enough to make
it into the playoffs and only solidifies Joey as the 5-seed. Joey will go into the playoffs as an underdog squad, with his only weakness being the
boom or bust nature of his flex players most of the time. The team overall is strong, but will they be consistent and put up the numbers he's looking
for to win?

Mike lost against Ian, solidifying Ian's 6 seed and also doing nothing for himself. He will go into the Toilet Bowl as a huge underdog, however
with Prad's injuries it may be a closer matchup than we think. Ian will also be a huge underdog but it seems very unlikely he makes it far as it is a tough
road against the top-5 teams. He has great matchups in Week 15 which gives him a chance to make it to the second round.

The next two matchups this past week were all in the top-4 teams, they're all close as I'm typing this and it might shake up the seeding a little bit. All
these teams are tough competitors, with Ishan and Neil looking to make it back to the finals for a possible rematch, while Savan and Sam are seeking their 
second rings. Neil has been doing well without Jefferson and Andrews, Ishan has been riding the Dolphins, Savan is holding 3 defenses for a "positional advantage,"
and Sam is looking kinda mid but his team is going off so I can't hate too much. I won't bother writing much more about their matchups, just know that Savan
is NOT winning this year and I hope his drought since 2016 continues for another decade or so.
