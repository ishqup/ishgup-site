*Ishan's Most Scary Teams
1. Neil
2. Joey
5. Ian ↑2
4. Sam
6. Savan ↑1
3. Prad ↓3
7. Mike

## Summary

Mike won! Sam is still the only person in Stonks history to go 2-12. Pretty low scoring week, it's likely that may be the case next week as well
with the Dolphins and Chiefs on bye. Ian is showing signs of life and dominance as he is closing in on a 0.500 record soon. The league seems to be
the closest it's ever been and it would be really interesting to see if anyone gets above 10 wins this season. Ishan is trash agaun with the Dolphins
proving themselves to be frauds. Savan played well, Neil played well. Prad's team flopped but injury has plagued him a bit this season. To me it's 
anyone's championship and there's no clear number 1 at this point.

## Week 10 Matchup Predictions

[My Pick] Joey +132 / 44.06% - 56.94% / -126 Sam

Neil -118 / 55.19% - 45.81% / +123 Ian [My Pick]

Ishan -112 / 53.89% - 47.11% / +117 Prad [My Pick]

[My Pick] Savan -255 / 73.27% - 27.73% / +268 Mike

## Notes

* I'll fix the notes next week (I got lazy I'll do it next time I think)
